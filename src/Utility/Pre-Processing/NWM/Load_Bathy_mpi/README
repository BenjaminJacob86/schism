Loading DEMs to horizontal grid:
1)You need have DEM tiles ready. On sciclone or james, you can find them under:
# sample: $DEM_dir = '/ches/data10/whuang07/Case1/DEMs/DEM_pre/DEM/';
# sample: $DEM_dir = '/sciclone/data10/whuang07/NWM/DEM/DEM/';

2)you need have a input hgrid.old: the old hgrid.gr3 that the DEMs to be loaded, note that the projection must be lat/lon
