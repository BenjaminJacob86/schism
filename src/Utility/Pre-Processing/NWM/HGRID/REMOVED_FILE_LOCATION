The sample grid files are save at:

This *.map was created under the map module of "generic 2D model" in SMS 11.
To read it in SMS 13's community edition that does not have the module, do

>> cat old.map | sed '/^COVERAGE_MODEL_NAME/d' |  sed '/^GENMESHARC/d' | sed 's/2DMESH/MESH_GENERATION/g' >  new.map

, which removes/replaces some strings in the map (ascii) file
